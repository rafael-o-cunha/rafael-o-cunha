### 🗂️ About:
This space was created to organize and facilitate access to all my various *public* projects and studies, which are divided into categories and technology stacks. My aim is to offer a clear and structured view of what I've been developing, allowing you to easily navigate and explore each one.

### 📌  Organization
Categories:
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Web:</strong> Development of web applications, APIs, etc.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Desktop:</strong> Desktop development, CLI, etc.
  <li>
    <strong>devops:</strong> Devops, infra, cloud, CI/CD
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Others:</strong> Experimental projects, tests or projects that do not fit into the above categories.
  </li>
</ul>

Each category has a direct link to the respective repository, where you will find specific details about each project, including technologies used, functionalities, and instructions for running or contributing.

### 🎯 Objective

This index has been created to make navigation more intuitive and organized, allowing you to quickly find what you're looking for. Whether you're a recruiter or someone interested in exploring new ideas and collaborating with me, this repository serves as a starting point for discovering more about the projects and technologies I use or am practicing.

Explore the categories below and dive into the details of each project.
I'm always open to tips and insights.

Thanks for visiting!
