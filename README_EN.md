### 🗂️ About:
This space was created to organize and facilitate access to all my various *public* projects and studies, which are divided by categories and technology stacks. My goal is to offer a clear and structured view of the projects I've been developing, allowing you to easily navigate and explore each one.

### 📌  Organization
The projects are organized into different categories, based on the type of project and the stacks used:
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Web:</strong> Projects focused on the development of web applications, APIs, etc.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Desktop:</strong> Projects based on desktop development, CLI, etc.
  <li>
    <strong>devops:</strong> Projects focused on devops, infra, cloud, CI/CD
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Others:</strong> Experimental projects, tests or projects that do not fit into the above categories.
  </li>
</ul>

Each category has a direct link to the respective repository, where you will find specific details about each project, including technologies used, functionalities, and instructions for running or contributing.

### 🎯 Objective

This index has been created to make navigation more intuitive and organized, allowing you to quickly find what you're looking for. Whether you're a recruiter or someone interested in exploring new ideas and collaborating with me, this repository serves as a starting point for finding out more about projects and technologies I use or am practicing.

Explore the categories below and dive into the details of each project.
I'm always open to tips and insights on organization, technology and projects.

Thanks for visiting!
